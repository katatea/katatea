## katatea
I'm katatea (he/him), a 17yo game developer currently in high school. I work with Roblox & luaU mostly creating a game named [**Eyes of Diamond**](https://www.roblox.com/communities/4318317/Eyes-of-Diamond#!/about).

Feel free to (contact me)[https://discord.com/users/451426493118283777]!

Besides luaU, I've dabbled in these languages:

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cs,js,py)](https://skillicons.dev)

these have mostly been for school or for personal projects, so I don't have much professional experience in them.
